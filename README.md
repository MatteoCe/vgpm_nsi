# NPP Normalized Seasonality Index calculator

This repository store the scripts used in the paper "XXX" to calculate the Normalized Seasonality Index (NSI) of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP), following<sup>1</sup>. This index is computed on the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM), following codes and instructions at the Ocean Productivity website (http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/).

The scripts download, process and calculate the VGPM model from the ancillary data indicated by the Ocean Productivity website, providing a final average NSI index, for the specified time range and decimal coordinates bounding box. Both 8day and monthly data can be processed.

## Installation

The two scripts, "main" and "vgpm nsi", are written in bash and R respectively, and rely on a limited number of programs and R packages. In order to use the scripts, _GDAL_<sup>2</sup> (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library), _GNU parallel_ and the R packages _tidyverse_<sup>3</sup> and _parallel_<sup>4</sup> must be installed. The scripts must be run from the bash terminal, after assuring that R can be run from it.

## Usage

The scripts can be run at once by navigating to a directory that must include both scripts and the data sub-directory, which will store the two files "manifest", with the list of http links to the ancillary data for chlorophyll, photosynthetically active radiation and sea surface temperatures, and "region_coord", a tsv file with the bounding box for the geographical region of interest. After editing both files as interested (if monthly data are required modify the manifest list including "month" instead of 8day in each link), the scripts can be run with this command:

	bash -i main.sh 8day		# change the argument to "month" if monthly data are required
