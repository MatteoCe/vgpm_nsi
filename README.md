# NPP Normalized Seasonality Index calculator

This repository store the scripts used in the paper "XXX" to calculate the Normalized Seasonality Index (NSI) of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP), following Brown et al. (2014). This index is computed on the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM), following codes and instructions at the Ocean Productivity website (http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/).

The scripts download, process and calculate the VGPM model from the ancillary data indicated by the Ocean Productivity website, providing a final average NSI index, for the specified time range and decimal coordinates bounding box. Both 8day and monthly data can be processed.
